# CommunicationFragments

Simple MVP Application that uses a single Activity and a couple fragments to show a proper way of communication between them
and i mean i am not talking about passing data between them ^^ 

Passing data there are a couple ways to do that you can check my projects i am pretty sure i did cover that already.

As Android Official Dev page say's you have to use Callbacks and treat the Fragments as simple View that they are but with slighly diffrent lifecycle than Activity with 5 more methods xD

What is happening here well you have to check for your self i am providing a simple project that is already there but this is a good point to start with. 

Project Structure?

- MVP
- Views
- Presenter 
- Iterator

How is this happening?

- good starting point to get where is this going and i pretty much explained that this is happening with Callbacks
